# Keycloak + Public Demo Wallet (eudi-test.dev)

This example connects local Keycloak issuer and verifier services to the shared wallet at <https://eudi-test.dev>. It reuses the realms, extension, demo UI and scripts from [`keycloak-web-wallet`](../keycloak-web-wallet/README.md).

The public wallet fetches request objects and calls token endpoints from its server, so Keycloak must be reachable from the internet. `start.sh` opens an ngrok tunnel, and `--proxy-headers=xforwarded` lets Keycloak generate public URLs for tunneled requests.

## Requirements

- Docker compose (as in the local example)
- The [ngrok CLI](https://ngrok.com/download) with any account, or your own public https URL that forwards to the local Keycloak (set `KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_URL` to skip ngrok)

With the free ngrok plan, browsers see a one-time interstitial warning page on the first visit to the tunnel URL. Click through it once per browser session. Server-to-server requests (the wallet fetching the request object, token calls) are not affected. A reserved domain (`NGROK_DOMAIN=your-domain.ngrok.app`) or a paid plan removes the interstitial.

## Quick Start

```bash
cd examples/keycloak-web-wallet-public
./start.sh
```

Then open the demo UI at <http://localhost:9090>:

- **Issuance**: creates a credential offer in Keycloak and shows a clickable `https://eudi-test.dev/credential-offer?...` link. Clicking it delivers the offer to the public wallet, which shows the consent request in its UI. Approving imports the membership credential.
- **Verification**: "Login with wallet" is a plain OIDC login: the browser goes to Keycloak through the tunnel, whose login page links to `https://eudi-test.dev/authorize?...`. The public wallet shows the consent request in its UI. Approving presents the PID credential, and the browser returns through Keycloak to the app's `/callback` with the ID-token claims on screen.

Stop everything with `docker compose down` and `kill $(cat .ngrok.pid)`.

## Differences to the Local Example

- **The wallet is shared.** Everything you issue lands in the one public demo wallet, is visible to every visitor of eudi-test.dev, can be deleted by anyone, and disappears with the daily reset. Do not enter personal data.
- **Per-browser consent.** The consent request for your flow appears only in the browser that started it (bound by the `eudi_session` cookie), so approve it there. The activity log and stored credentials are still shared with every visitor.
- **No headless demo scripts.** `demo-issuance.py` and `demo-verification.py` approve the consent over the API, which the public wallet does not allow for browser-driven flows (those need interactive consent in the wallet UI). Use the demo UI in the browser instead.
- **No truststore or CA export.** The public wallet serves its trust list and status lists behind a publicly trusted certificate, so Keycloak's default truststore already covers it. The verifier trusts the wallet's credentials through `trustListUrl` (`https://eudi-test.dev/api/trustlist`), configured by the same script as in the local example.

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `WALLET_BASE_URL` | `https://eudi-test.dev` | Public wallet instance to run against (any `--demo` deployment works, see [docs/public-demo.md](../../docs/public-demo.md)) |
| `KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_URL` | set by `start.sh` via ngrok | Public origin that forwards to the local Keycloak |
| `NGROK_DOMAIN` | none | Reserved ngrok domain for a stable tunnel URL |
| `KEYCLOAK_PORT` / `APP_PORT` | `9080` / `9090` | Local ports, next free port is picked automatically |

Because the wallet is a public deployment outside this compose project, restarting the example does not reset wallet state (the shared wallet resets itself daily).
