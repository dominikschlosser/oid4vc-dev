# Docker Verifier Testing Guide

The Docker image is built for automated integration testing of OID4VP verifiers. The container is an EUDI wallet your verifier can send presentation requests to.

## Quick start

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev:latest
docker run -p 8085:8085 -p 8086:8086 ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev
```

The default CMD starts the wallet server headless with pre-loaded PID credentials.

Override the command to use any CLI feature:

```bash
echo "eyJhbGci..." | docker run -i ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev decode
docker run -i ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev validate --trust-list https://example.com/trustlist.jwt < credential.txt
```

## Demo profile

The container also runs the demo profile of the public instance at [eudi-test.dev](https://eudi-test.dev):

```bash
docker run -d --name eudi-demo -p 8085:8085 -p 8086:8086 \
  ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev:latest \
  wallet serve --demo --port 8085 --base-url http://localhost:8085
```

`--demo` seeds the four-PID baseline, runs HAIP in debug mode at OpenID4VCI feature level 1.1, disables the process and filesystem endpoints, and resets the wallet hourly (`--demo-reset` changes the schedule). The wallet UI is at `http://localhost:8085`, the demo issuer at `/issuer/`, the demo verifier at `/verifier/` and the decoder at `/decoder/`. The HTTPS issuer endpoints answer on port 8086 with a self-signed certificate.

Without a volume the state lives in memory (see [Storage](#storage)). Stopping the container discards every credential. The keys and the CA derive from the image's built-in seed and come back the same on the next start (see [Stateless container](#stateless-container)). The full deployment (TLS termination, rate limiting, usage statistics, persistence) is the compose example in [examples/public-demo](../examples/public-demo/), described in [public demo hosting](public-demo.md).

## Storage

The image sets `EUDI_DEV_STORAGE=auto`. The wallet then keeps its state in memory unless a state directory is mounted or named (a volume at `/home/app/.eudi-dev`, `EUDI_DEV_HOME`, or `--wallet-dir`). A container without a volume needs no writable filesystem, so it runs with `--read-only` (the start prints a warning that the instance registry could not be written). A container with a volume keeps its state in files.

Pass `-e EUDI_DEV_STORAGE=...` (or `--storage` on the command) to choose explicitly:

| Value | State lives in |
|-------|----------------|
| `file` | The wallet directory, as on the CLI |
| `memory` | The process. Gone when the container stops |
| `auto` | Files when a state directory is mounted or named, memory otherwise (the image default) |
| `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` | One table (`eudi_dev_state`) in that database, created on first use |

### Stateless container

A container without a volume regenerates its keys on every start. With `EUDI_DEV_SEED` set, the holder key, the issuer key, the CA key and the TLS key derive from that string, so every start (and every container started with the same seed) serves the same keys and the same CA. Verifiers keep trusting the trust list they fetched before a restart, and no volume, backup or database is needed. The certificates themselves are signed anew on each start with fresh serials, so their bytes differ while their keys and subjects stay the same.

The image sets `EUDI_DEV_SEED=auto`: the built-in seed applies when the state lives in memory and random keys are generated whenever a volume or a database holds the state. The built-in seed is public, so anyone can derive those keys, and `wallet serve` says so in its startup summary (see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)). Set your own value with `-e EUDI_DEV_SEED=<seed>` (or `--seed`) for a test bench, or an empty value for random keys.

```bash
docker run --read-only -p 8085:8085 -p 8086:8086 -e EUDI_DEV_SEED=my-bench ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev
```

### Shared database

Several containers pointed at the same database serve one wallet: the same keys, the same CA, the same credentials. [examples/load-test](../examples/load-test/README.md) runs two wallet servers on one database behind an nginx ingress, the target for load and performance tests.

Each wallet server re-reads the shared state on every request and writes only what it changed (a row per credential, log entry and status entry), so servers issuing and presenting at the same time keep each other's changes. The database holds the keys and the CA in the clear, as the wallet directory does (see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md)).

## How it works

1. The container starts with `--pid` (two pre-loaded EUDI PID credentials, one SD-JWT and one mDoc) and `--auto-accept` (presents matching credentials without user consent)
2. Your verifier sends an OID4VP authorization request to the wallet's `/authorize` endpoint
3. The wallet evaluates the DCQL query, finds matching credentials, creates a VP token, and POSTs it to your verifier's `response_uri`

## Wallet endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/authorize` | GET/POST | OID4VP authorization endpoint, accepting the standard OID4VP query parameters (`client_id`, `response_type`, `dcql_query`, `nonce`, `state`, `response_uri`, `response_mode`, `request_uri`) |
| `/api/trustlist` | GET | Legacy trust-list endpoint. Returns the PID trust list when one is registered, otherwise the first available trust-list profile |
| `/api/trustlists` | GET | JSON index of all trust-list profiles registered in the wallet. Each entry includes a relative `path` plus optional `advertised_url` / legacy `url` |
| `/api/trustlists/<id>` | GET | ETSI trust list JWT for one trust-list profile |
| `https://<wallet>:8086/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` | GET | OpenID Credential Issuer metadata with `issuer_info` / `registrar_dataset` authorization data. JSON by default, the signed JWT form (`application/jwt`) when the Accept header asks for only that |
| `https://<wallet>:8086/.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer` | GET | JWT VC issuer metadata for wallet-issued SD-JWTs. Exposes the signing key by `kid` and leaf `x5c` chain |
| `/api/registrar/wrp` | GET | Registrar-style signed dataset for provider entitlements and `providesAttestations`. Supports query filters such as `identifier`, `entitlement`, and `providesattestation` |
| `/api/credentials` | GET/POST | List all credentials / import a credential |
| `/api/credentials/<id>/status` | GET/POST | Resolve or set the revocation status for a credential |
| `/api/statuslist` | GET | Status List Token on both HTTP and HTTPS. JWT by default, CWT for a client sending `Accept: application/statuslist+cwt` (`--status-list` only controls whether generated credentials reference the list) |
| `/api/templates`, `/api/templates/<name>` | GET/PUT/DELETE | List and manage [credential templates](templates.md) |
| `/api/next-error` | POST/DELETE | Set or clear a one-shot error override |
| `/api/config/preferred-format` | PUT | Set credential format preference (`dc+sd-jwt` / `mso_mdoc` / `jwt_vc_json` / empty) |
| `/api/config` | GET | Instance introspection (PID baseline, directories, URLs, behavior) |
| `/api/shutdown` | POST | Stop the wallet server process |

## Typical verifier integration test flow

1. Start the wallet container
2. Your verifier builds an OID4VP authorization request with a DCQL query for PID attributes
3. Send the request to `http://<wallet>/authorize?client_id=...&response_type=vp_token&response_mode=direct_post&response_uri=http://<your-verifier>/callback&nonce=...&dcql_query=...`
4. The wallet selects matching credentials and POSTs `vp_token` + `state` to your `response_uri`
5. Your verifier validates the VP token's signing chain against the wallet's trust list from `/api/trustlist`
6. For EUDI issuer authorization checks, resolve provider entitlements and attestation types from the signed `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` metadata and `/api/registrar/wrp`

Behind Docker port mappings or Testcontainers, resolve the relative `path` from `/api/trustlists` against the URL you used to reach the wallet. `advertised_url` is the wallet's configured issuer URL and can differ from that.

## Docker Compose example

```yaml
services:
  wallet:
    image: ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev:latest
    ports:
      - "8085:8085"
      - "8086:8086"
  verifier:
    build: .
    environment:
      WALLET_URL: http://wallet:8085
      # Use the wallet's trust list to validate received VP tokens
      TRUST_LIST_URL: http://wallet:8085/api/trustlist
      # Use signed issuer metadata + registrar data for EUDI issuer authorization checks
      OPENID_CREDENTIAL_ISSUER_URL: https://wallet:8086/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer
      REGISTRAR_URL: https://wallet:8086/api/registrar/wrp
      # Optional: use the wallet's issuer metadata for SD-JWT key discovery
      ISSUER_METADATA_URL: https://wallet:8086/.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer
```

## Testcontainers (Java)

```java
GenericContainer<?> wallet = new GenericContainer<>("ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev:latest")
    .withExposedPorts(8085)
    .waitingFor(Wait.forHttp("/api/trustlist").forStatusCode(200));
wallet.start();

String walletUrl = "http://" + wallet.getHost() + ":" + wallet.getMappedPort(8085);

// Send an OID4VP request to the wallet
String authorizeUrl = walletUrl + "/authorize"
    + "?client_id=" + URLEncoder.encode(verifierClientId, UTF_8)
    + "&response_type=vp_token"
    + "&response_mode=direct_post"
    + "&response_uri=" + URLEncoder.encode(callbackUrl, UTF_8)
    + "&nonce=" + nonce
    + "&dcql_query=" + URLEncoder.encode(dcqlQuery, UTF_8);

// The wallet will auto-accept and POST the VP token to your callbackUrl
httpClient.send(HttpRequest.newBuilder(URI.create(authorizeUrl)).GET().build(),
    HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

// Validate received credentials using the wallet's trust list
String trustListUrl = walletUrl + "/api/trustlist";
```

## Testcontainers (Go)

```go
ctx := context.Background()
wallet, _ := testcontainers.GenericContainer(ctx, testcontainers.GenericContainerRequest{
    ContainerRequest: testcontainers.ContainerRequest{
        Image:        "ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev:latest",
        ExposedPorts: []string{"8085/tcp"},
        WaitingFor:   wait.ForHTTP("/api/trustlist").WithPort("8085"),
    },
    Started: true,
})

walletURL, _ := wallet.Endpoint(ctx, "http")
// Send OID4VP request to walletURL + "/authorize?..."
// Wallet POSTs VP token back to your response_uri
// Validate with trust list from walletURL + "/api/trustlist"
```

## Custom PID claims

The default CMD loads two EUDI PID credentials (SD-JWT + mDoc) with the EUDI PID Rulebook attributes (`given_name`, `family_name`, `birth_date`, `place_of_birth`, `nationality`, etc.). To customize them, mount a folder of [credential templates](templates.md) that overrides the pre-defined PID templates (or adds your own):

```bash
# my-templates/pid-sdjwt.json overrides the pre-defined PID template
docker run -p 8085:8085 -v ./my-templates:/templates ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev \
  wallet serve --auto-accept --pid --port 8085 --templates-dir /templates
```

Or generate customized PIDs into a mounted data directory first. Mount the parent of `wallet/`, so the shared CA persists alongside the credentials:

```bash
docker run --rm -v wallet-data:/home/app/.eudi-dev ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev \
  issue sdjwt --wallet --template german-pid-sdjwt --claims '{"given_name":"MAX","family_name":"POWER"}'

docker run -p 8085:8085 -v wallet-data:/home/app/.eudi-dev ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev \
  wallet serve --auto-accept --port 8085
```

## Testing API

The wallet exposes API endpoints that control its behavior in automated tests.

### Error simulation

Set a one-shot error response. The next OID4VP request returns it, then normal behavior resumes.

```bash
# Set up error for next request
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/next-error \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"error": "access_denied", "error_description": "Simulated denial"}'

# Clear without consuming
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8085/api/next-error
```

### Format preference

When the DCQL query matches both SD-JWT and mDoc credentials, choose which format is presented:

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8085/api/config/preferred-format \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"format": "dc+sd-jwt"}'   # or "mso_mdoc" or "" to clear
```

Or set it at startup: `--preferred-format dc+sd-jwt`

### Credential import

The wallet imports SD-JWT (`dc+sd-jwt`), plain JWT VC (`jwt_vc_json`), and mDoc (`mso_mdoc`). Plain JWT VCs are presented as-is.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials -d 'eyJhbGci...'
```

### Status list (revocation)

With `wallet serve --pid`, generated credentials carry a status list reference pointing to `https://<host>:<port+1>/api/statuslist`. `--status-list` turns the reference on for any generated credential.

The HTTPS issuer URL uses the same host selection. By default the issuer runs on `https://<host>:<port+1>` and serves `/.well-known/jwt-vc-issuer`, the signed `/.well-known/openid-credential-issuer` endpoint, and `/api/registrar/wrp`.

For verifier tests that need to trust that HTTPS endpoint, export the persisted certificate:

```bash
eudi wallet tls-cert --docker --out wallet-tls-cert.pem
```

To trust all spawned wallets from one root instead of pinning one leaf certificate, export the shared wallet CA:

```bash
eudi wallet ca-cert --out wallet-ca-cert.pem
```

The status list URI and issuer host are written into credentials at generation time. When the verifier runs inside Docker and the wallet on the host (or the other way round), use `--docker` (or `--base-url` for a custom URL) so the status list URL, signed issuer metadata, and registrar endpoints are reachable from both sides:

```bash
# Wallet on host, verifier in Docker
eudi wallet serve --pid --auto-accept --docker
```

```yaml
# Docker Compose: both in containers, use the service name
services:
  wallet:
    image: ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev:latest
    command: ["wallet", "serve", "--auto-accept", "--pid", "--port", "8085",
              "--base-url", "http://wallet:8085"]
    ports:
      - "8085:8085"
      - "8086:8086"
```

Toggle revocation at runtime:

```bash
# Revoke (status=1)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials/<id>/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"status": 1}'

# Un-revoke (status=0)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/credentials/<id>/status \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"status": 0}'
```

> See [wallet HTTP API](wallet/http-api.md) for the full API and an end-to-end example. The API has no authentication. Keep it inside isolated test networks, or use the `--demo` profile for internet-facing deployments (see [public demo hosting](public-demo.md)).

## Supported response modes

`direct_post` (default) and `direct_post.jwt` (JARM, the response encrypted to the verifier's ephemeral key from the request object).
