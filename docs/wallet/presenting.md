# Presenting from the wallet

The wallet answers an OID4VP presentation request from the CLI (`wallet accept`), from a scanned QR (`wallet scan`), or at its own `/authorize` URL. `--haip` checks the request against HAIP 1.0. The same `wallet accept` command dispatches a credential offer (see [issuing into the wallet](issuing.md)).

## `wallet accept <uri>`

Detects the URI type and dispatches to the matching flow:

- `openid4vp://`, `haip-vp://`, `eudi-openid4vp://`: OID4VP presentation (evaluates DCQL, shows the consent UI, submits the VP token)
  - Supports `response_type=vp_token id_token` (SIOPv2 + OID4VP combined flow). Generates a self-issued ID token alongside the VP token
  - Supports `response_type=id_token` (SIOPv2 only). Generates a self-issued ID token without VP token
- `openid-credential-offer://`, `haip-vci://`: OID4VCI credential issuance (fetches the credential from the issuer)

In interactive mode (the default), OID4VP requests start a temporary consent UI server and open it in the browser. With `--auto-accept`, the wallet submits one credential per credential query (the most recently issued one that matches it).

When a verifier answers a presentation with a `redirect_uri`, the wallet prints the URL and opens it in a browser (a same-device flow returns to the verifier's site). A scripted run, or a host without a desktop, only prints it. `--no-open` disables opening.

`debug` mode matches DCQL queries loosely, which helps troubleshoot verifier queries. A credential that matches the requested format and metadata and at least one requested claim counts as a match with a warning, even when other required claim paths are missing. `strict` mode requires every claim path.

```bash
eudi wallet accept 'openid4vp://authorize?...' --auto-accept
eudi wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...'
eudi wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...' --tx-code 123456
```

|-------------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------|

| `--session-transcript`  | `oid4vp` | mDoc session transcript mode: `oid4vp` or `iso`  |
| `--tx-code`             | —        | Transaction code for OID4VCI pre-authorized code flow |
| `--docker`              | `false`  | Serve the trust and status lists under `host.docker.internal` so a verifier in a container reaches them |
| `--key-attestation-level` | — | What the key attestation claims as `key_storage` and `user_authentication`: whatever the issuer requires (default), `none`, or an Appendix D.2 level such as `iso_18045_high` for both (see [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md)). A running wallet server applies its own setting |
| `--haip`                | `false`  | Check incoming presentations and credential offers against HAIP 1.0. `--mode` decides what a violation does: strict refuses the flow, debug reports it and continues |

Pre-authorized code offers work directly with `wallet accept`. Authorization code offers require a running `wallet serve` instance. The client ID defaults to the wallet origin and the redirect URI to its `/callback` endpoint. Override them with `--vci-client-id` and `--vci-redirect-uri`. The wallet uses PAR and DPoP when advertised by the issuer.

For sign-in, `wallet accept` prints the authorization URL. It opens the URL only when no wallet page is already handling the flow, because the request can be used once (RFC 9126 §4). After the issuer redirects back, the wallet exchanges the code. The CLI waits for the credential or an error. A remote wallet follows the same process. See [sign-in during issuance](issuing.md#sign-in-during-issuance).

For pre-authorized code offers, HAIP validation checks HTTPS transport. PAR, PKCE, DPoP and client authentication requirements apply to offers that use the authorization endpoint.

## `wallet scan`

Scans a QR code from an image file or screen capture and detects the content:

- `openid4vp://`: delegates to `accept` (OID4VP presentation)
- `openid-credential-offer://`: delegates to `accept` (OID4VCI issuance)
- SD-JWT / mDoc raw credential: delegates to `import`

```bash
eudi wallet scan qr-image.png
eudi wallet scan --screen              # macOS interactive screen capture
eudi wallet scan --screen --auto-accept # auto-approve if it's a presentation
```

`wallet scan` reads the QR code, then runs the same flow as `wallet accept`. It sends the request to a configured remote or running wallet and opens that wallet's consent UI. Otherwise, it handles the request locally.

The wallet handling the flow fetches the offer and asks for any transaction code. For a local flow, the CLI prompts when stdin is a terminal and `--tx-code` was not given. See [ADR-0012](../adr/0012-every-entry-point-runs-the-same-flow.md).

`wallet scan` uses the persistent `wallet --mode` setting and accepts the same `--auto-accept`, `--tx-code` and `--haip` flags as `accept`.

## Invoking the wallet by URL

Both wallet flows can also be invoked at the wallet's own URL, wherever a verifier or issuer would emit a custom-scheme link. This works in hosted environments, automated tests, containers, and on platforms without scheme registration (custom schemes are registered on macOS only).

The URLs take exactly the same query parameters as their custom-scheme counterparts:

| Custom scheme | Wallet URL |
|---------------|------------|
| `openid4vp://?<params>` or `openid4vp://authorize?<params>` | `http://localhost:8085/authorize?<params>` |
| `openid-credential-offer://?<params>` | `http://localhost:8085/credential-offer?<params>` |

To convert a link, replace everything before the `?` with the wallet endpoint URL and keep the query string unchanged.

In a custom-scheme URI the part between `://` and `?` has no meaning, so `openid4vp://?...` and `openid4vp://authorize?...` are the same request. A web URL needs a path to identify the flow. `/authorize` follows the OAuth convention (in OID4VP the wallet is the authorization server), and `/credential-offer` is named after the OID4VCI credential offer endpoint.

```bash
# Presentation request: standard OID4VP authorization request parameters
curl 'http://localhost:8085/authorize?client_id=...&request_uri=...'

# Credential offer by reference
curl 'http://localhost:8085/credential-offer?credential_offer_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fissuer.example%2Foffer%2F123'

# Credential offer by value (url-encoded offer JSON), with a transaction code
curl 'http://localhost:8085/credential-offer?credential_offer=%7B...%7D&tx_code=1234'
```

`/credential-offer` accepts `credential_offer` or `credential_offer_uri`, plus an optional `tx_code` for the pre-authorized code flow.

Browser navigations are GET requests that accept HTML, such as clicked links. After a presentation, the browser goes to the verifier's `redirect_uri`, or to the wallet UI if none was returned. After importing an offer, it goes to the wallet UI.

Other callers, including curl and test harnesses, receive the same JSON responses as `POST /api/presentations` and `POST /api/offers`. Verifiers and issuers can use these wallet URLs to complete a browser flow without custom schemes. For example, `keycloak-extension-oid4vp` can set `walletScheme` to the wallet's `/authorize` URL.

In interactive mode (no `--auto-accept`) the two callers also differ before consent. A browser navigation redirects to the wallet UI, which shows the pending consent request and continues the flow once approved (a presentation then navigates on to the verifier's `redirect_uri`). An API call blocks until the request is approved or denied, in the UI or via `POST /api/requests/{id}/approve`.

## HAIP 1.0 Enforcement

`--haip` on `wallet serve` or `wallet accept` checks incoming requests and offers against [HAIP 1.0 Final](https://openid.net/specs/openid4vc-high-assurance-interoperability-profile-1_0-final.html). `--demo` turns it on by default (see [hosting a public demo](../public-demo.md)).

`--haip` and `--mode` are separate switches. `--haip` adds every check below to the ones that apply to any counterparty. `--mode` decides what happens on a finding. `--mode strict` stops the flow and `--mode debug` reports it and continues. So `--haip --mode debug` reports every profile violation and still completes the flow, which is useful for a counterparty under development.

For **presentations** (OID4VP `direct_post.jwt` and Browser API `dc_api.jwt`) the wallet checks every request against all of:

- `response_type` must be `vp_token` (§5)
- `response_mode` must be `direct_post.jwt` (§5.1) or `dc_api.jwt` (§5.2)
- A signed request must use the `x509_hash:` Client Identifier Prefix (§5), and its Request Object signature must verify against a certificate whose SHA-256 is the prefix value
- The certificate signing the request must not be self-signed, and the trust anchor must not be included in the `x5c` header (§5)
- A request arriving over redirects must carry a signed request object (JAR) delivered through `request_uri` (§5.1). An unsigned request is accepted only over the Digital Credentials API, where §5.2 requires the wallet to support one, and such a request has no `client_id`
- The query must use DCQL (§5), and every credential it asks for must be `mso_mdoc` (§5.3.1) or `dc+sd-jwt` (§5.3.2)
- The Verifier's client metadata must list both `A128GCM` and `A256GCM` in `encrypted_response_enc_values_supported` (§5)
- A signed Digital Credentials API request must list the caller origin in `expected_origins` (OpenID4VP Appendix A.2, which §5.2 incorporates)
- The request object signing algorithm must be `ES256`

In `--mode strict` a non-compliant request is refused with an HTTP 400 listing the failed checks. In `--mode debug` the same findings are logged as warnings and the flow continues.

For **issuance**, HAIP §6.1.1 checks the received credential. An SD-JWT VC must include its issuer signing certificate and chain in `x5c`, without the trust anchor. The signing certificate must not be self-signed.

The credential issuer must use HTTPS, with a loopback exception. Authorization code flows also require the authorization server to support that grant and offer PAR when using the authorization endpoint.

PKCE and DPoP metadata is checked when present. A server advertising PKCE without `S256`, or DPoP without `ES256`, violates the profile. Omitted metadata is accepted because the referenced OAuth specifications make these fields optional and FAPI 2.0 constrains server behavior. Client authentication metadata is not checked.

For pre-authorized offers, only the HTTPS transport rule applies to this part of validation. HAIP §4 requires support for authorization code issuance but scopes PAR to use of the authorization endpoint.

The prefix rule comes from the profile. §5 allows only `x509_hash` for signed requests, so `x509_san_dns` is refused even though OpenID4VP defines it. An unsigned request is one that arrives over the Digital Credentials API without a Request Object. Appendix A.2 of OpenID4VP says such a request carries no `client_id` and a wallet ignores one that is present. The caller is identified by the origin the platform reports. §7 requires at least ES256, and this wallet advertises ES256 in `request_object_signing_alg_values_supported`. As a client the wallet always follows the profile (PAR, PKCE S256, DPoP, wallet attestation when advertised, ES256 proofs, key attestation), so `--haip` only affects what it refuses from an issuer or a verifier.

```bash
eudi wallet serve --haip --auto-accept --pid
eudi wallet accept --haip 'openid4vp://authorize?...'
```

Every request to a given wallet uses the same validation mode, HAIP and encrypted-request settings.
