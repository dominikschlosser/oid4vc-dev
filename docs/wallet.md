# Wallet

A stateful testing wallet with CLI-driven OID4VP/VCI flows, QR scanning, and OS URL scheme registration. Credentials and keys are stored in `~/.eudi-dev/wallet/` (configurable via `--wallet-dir`) and persist across invocations. The same state can live in memory or in a Postgres database instead (see [Storage backends](#storage-backends)).

The wallet has two validation modes. Both run the same checks. The mode decides what happens to a finding:
- `debug` (default) reports each finding and keeps processing the request. During DCQL evaluation it warns and keeps a credential match when some required claim paths are missing but other requested claims still match
- `strict` treats the same findings as errors and refuses the request

`--haip` is a separate switch. See [HAIP 1.0 enforcement](wallet/presenting.md#haip-10-enforcement).

For OpenID Foundation conformance work, see [docs/conformance.md](./conformance.md).
For interaction diagrams of the implemented OID4VP and OID4VCI flows, see [docs/diagrams](./diagrams/README.md).

## Quick start

```bash
# Issue PID credentials from the pre-defined templates and list them
eudi issue sdjwt --wallet --template pid-sdjwt
eudi issue mdoc --wallet --template pid-mdoc
eudi wallet list

# The German PID, which extends the country-independent one
eudi issue sdjwt --wallet --template german-pid-sdjwt
eudi issue mdoc --wallet --template german-pid-mdoc

# Deprecated equivalent (issues both PIDs at once, will be removed later)
eudi wallet generate-pid

# Show a credential (raw)
eudi wallet show <id>

# Show a credential (human-readable decoded)
eudi wallet show --decoded <id>

# Start the wallet web UI with stored credentials
eudi wallet serve

# Start the wallet and register URL scheme handlers
eudi wallet serve --register

# Export the shared wallet CA for verifier trust stores
eudi wallet ca-cert --out wallet-ca-cert.pem

# Export the HTTPS wallet certificate for verifier trust stores
eudi wallet tls-cert --out wallet-tls-cert.pem

# Process an OID4VP request from the CLI
eudi wallet accept 'openid4vp://authorize?client_id=...'

# Accept a credential offer (auto-detected from URI)
eudi wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...'

# Scan a QR code from screen and auto-detect the flow
eudi wallet scan --screen

# Show wallet-side interactions
eudi wallet logs
eudi wallet logs -f

# Import a credential from a file
eudi wallet import credential.txt

# Register URL scheme handlers so openid4vp:// links open the wallet on macOS
eudi wallet register
```

On Linux and Windows, `wallet register` and `wallet unregister` are no-ops, so shared scripts stay portable. Open copied `openid4vp://` or `openid-credential-offer://` links with `eudi wallet accept '<uri>'`.

The macOS URL handler sends links to the active remote wallet. While a remote target is set with `wallet use <url>`, clicked links go to that instance (useful when the wallet runs in a Docker container), and the handler then opens the remote consent UI in the browser. `wallet use local` routes links back to the local wallet server.

## Credential type inheritance

A domestic PID extends the country-independent one. ARF Annex 2 (v3.0.0) PID_14 requires the vct to be "`urn:eudi:pid:1` for the type defined in this document or a domestic type that extends it", so `urn:eudi:pid:de:1` carries every attribute `urn:eudi:pid:1` defines plus the German ones.

The wallet matches a DCQL `vct_values` entry against the credential's own type and every type it extends. A request for `urn:eudi:pid:1` is answered by any PID, a request for `urn:eudi:pid:de:1` by a German PID. The `[DCQL]` server log records the requested type whenever a credential matched under a type other than its own.

The relationship comes from two places:

- the PID type itself. A segment after `urn:eudi:pid:` that is a country or region code (`urn:eudi:pid:de:1`, `urn:eudi:pid:fr:1`) marks a domestic type, which extends `urn:eudi:pid:1`. A segment that is a version number (`urn:eudi:pid:1`, `urn:eudi:pid:2`) marks the country-independent type
- the `aka_vcts` claim ([SD-JWT VC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-oauth-sd-jwt-vc/) §2.2.2.2), which lists further types a credential is also of. It applies to every credential type, and the German PID this tool issues carries it

Inheritance only describes the credential type. The signature and trust list checks still decide whether the issuer is authorized (§6.6: "Verifiers and Holders MUST NOT assume that any issuer who issues a credential extending a known type is authorized to do so").

In mdoc every PID carries the doctype `eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.1` (PID_05), and national elements are in a domestic namespace built by appending the country or region code to it (`eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.de.1`, PID_06). A `doctype_value` request therefore matches every PID, and a claim query addresses a national element by its namespace: `"path": ["eu.europa.ec.eudi.pid.de.1", "birth_name"]`.

## Storage

Everything the wallet holds is stored unencrypted, including private keys and any access or refresh tokens an issuer returns. This is a development and test wallet. Point it at test issuers only and treat the wallet directory as disposable.

All wallet state is stored in `~/.eudi-dev/wallet/` by default:

```
~/.eudi-dev/
├── wallet-ca-cert.pem  # Shared CA certificate used across wallet instances
├── wallet-ca-key.pem   # Shared CA private key
├── remote.json         # Active remote wallet target set by wallet use
├── instances/          # Registry of running wallet servers (one file per pid)
└── wallet/
    ├── wallet.json       # Credentials + metadata
    ├── holder.pem        # Holder EC private key (auto-generated on first use)
    ├── issuer.pem        # Issuer EC private key (for self-issued credentials)
    ├── wallet-log-cleaned-at # Timestamp marker written by wallet logs clean
    ├── wallet-tls-cert.pem # HTTPS certificate for wallet endpoints on port+1
    ├── wallet-tls-key.pem  # HTTPS private key for wallet endpoints on port+1
    ├── assets/             # Display images (card art) referenced from wallet.json
    └── templates/          # User credential templates (see templates.md)
```

A credential's display images (logo, background) are content-addressed files in `assets/`. `wallet.json` holds a reference (`asset:<hash>.<ext>`), so it stays small enough to reparse on every request and each image is stored once. A `data:` URI inside `wallet.json` is still served and moves to `assets/` on the next save.

Wallet interaction logs are stored in `wallet.json` under the top-level `log` field. `wallet logs clean` clears those entries and writes `wallet-log-cleaned-at`. A running wallet server drops in-memory entries older than that marker when it saves. With `--wallet-dir`, both are in that directory.

Keys are P-256 EC keys, auto-generated on first use and reused across invocations. Wallets under the same wallet base directory share a persisted **CA key** and build certificate chains from it:

1. **CA certificate**: self-signed, used as trust anchor in the trust list (`/api/trustlist`)
2. **Leaf certificate**: signed by the CA, wraps the issuer key's public key

Generated credentials are signed with the **issuer key**. SD-JWT credentials include a deterministic `kid` header, expose the signing key through JWT VC issuer metadata, and include the leaf signing certificate in `x5c`. The shared CA is the anchor in the wallet trust list, so verifiers validate the signing key through that chain.

Each wallet keeps its own issuer key. Its credential-signing leaf certificate and HTTPS wallet certificate are generated from the shared CA.

Generated credentials expire in **30 days** by default. Use `--exp` to override (e.g. `--exp 720h` for 30 days, `--exp 24h` for 1 day). Use `--nbf` to set a not-before time (RFC3339 or duration, e.g. `--nbf 2025-01-15T00:00:00Z` or `--nbf -1h`).

![Wallet UI](./assets/wallet-ui.png)

## `wallet show <id>`

Shows a stored credential by its ID (as printed by `wallet list`). An unambiguous id prefix also resolves. By default it prints only the raw credential string, so it can be piped. `--decoded` prints human-readable output (the `--json` and `-v` global flags apply). Decoded output begins with a validity line, since the payload contains the expiry only as a Unix timestamp.

`wallet list` shows the same in its `VALID` column: the time left (`29d`, `5h`, `expired`) or `-` for a credential without an expiry.

```bash
eudi wallet show <id>                  # Raw credential string
eudi wallet show --decoded <id>        # Human-readable output
eudi wallet show --decoded --json <id> # JSON output
```

| Flag        | Default | Description                                          |
|-------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `--decoded` | `false` | Show human-readable decoded output instead of raw    |

## `wallet logs`

Prints the persisted wallet-side protocol interactions: OID4VP request-object fetches, parsed presentation requests, wallet presentation responses, verifier responses, Browser API responses, OID4VCI credential offers, metadata fetches, token exchanges, credential requests, deferred/notification calls, and imported credentials.

Each entry prints on one line, so the output is easy to scan and pipe. Compact lines carry `event`, `direction`, source, endpoint, method, URL, client ID, issuer, response mode, nonce, status code, and payload-presence flags. The global `-v` / `--verbose` flag expands structured details such as request objects, DCQL queries, wallet metadata, token and credential request payloads, sent VP tokens, actual presented credentials, selected claims, verifier response bodies, received credential responses, and imported credential material. `-f` / `--follow` prints new entries as they are persisted, like `kubectl logs -f`.

```bash
eudi wallet logs              # One line per persisted wallet interaction
eudi wallet logs -v           # Expand request/response details
eudi wallet logs -f           # Print existing logs, then follow new entries
eudi wallet logs clean        # Remove old persisted wallet logs
eudi wallet logs --json       # JSON array of log entries
```

| Flag       | Default | Description                                      |
|------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `-f, --follow` | `false` | Keep running and print new entries as they appear. Local wallets only (a remote wallet is refused) |
| `-v, --verbose` | `false` | Global flag. Expand structured log details        |
| `--json`   | `false` | Global flag. Output the persisted log entries as JSON. Cannot be combined with `--follow` |

## Serving the wallet

`wallet serve` runs the persistent HTTP server: the web UI, the OID4VP and OID4VCI endpoints, the trust lists, and the management API. It loads credentials from disk, shows a browser consent dialog for incoming requests, and can register OS URL scheme handlers.

```bash
eudi wallet serve                      # web UI on http://localhost:8085
eudi wallet serve --auto-accept --pid  # headless, with default PIDs, for tests
```

See [serving the wallet](wallet/serve.md) for the endpoints, trust-list profiles, certificate export, URL scheme registration, runtime conformance settings, and every `wallet serve` flag.

## Presenting from the wallet

`wallet accept` answers an OID4VP presentation request (and dispatches a credential offer to issuance). `wallet scan` does the same from a QR code, and the same flows are reachable at the wallet's own `/authorize` and `/credential-offer` URLs without a custom scheme.

```bash
eudi wallet accept 'openid4vp://authorize?...'   # evaluate DCQL, consent, submit
eudi wallet scan --screen                        # scan a QR and dispatch
```

See [presenting from the wallet](wallet/presenting.md) for the full `wallet accept` and `wallet scan` reference, invoking the wallet by URL, and HAIP 1.0 enforcement.

## Issuing into the wallet

A credential offer is accepted with `wallet accept` (or the UI, a scanned QR, or the `/credential-offer` URL). The wallet handles sign-in at the issuer, deferred issuance, later renewal, and interactive (presentation-during-issuance) authorization.

```bash
eudi wallet accept 'openid-credential-offer://...'   # accept an offer
eudi wallet deferred                                 # what is still being collected
eudi wallet refresh <credential-id>                  # ask for a fresh copy
```

See [issuing into the wallet](wallet/issuing.md) for sign-in, renewal, deferred issuance, wallet attestation, the OpenID4VCI feature level (`--vci-version`), and interactive authorization.

## HTTP API

Everything the CLI does locally is also on a running `wallet serve` instance over HTTP (list, show, import, remove, issue, generate PIDs, manage templates, set status, export certificates, introspect, shut down). The API has no authentication and is for local development and isolated test networks.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8085/api/credentials
curl -X POST http://localhost:8085/api/issue -d '{"format":"sdjwt","pid":true}'
```

See [the wallet HTTP API](wallet/http-api.md) for every endpoint and for remote control (driving another instance from the CLI).

## Shared flags

All wallet subcommands accept `--wallet-dir` to override the storage directory, `--templates-dir` to override the credential template directory (see [templates](templates.md)) and `--storage` to choose the storage backend:

```bash
eudi wallet list --wallet-dir /tmp/test-wallet
eudi wallet serve --templates-dir ./my-templates
eudi wallet serve --storage memory
```

## Storage backends

Everything the wallet keeps (credentials, keys, the shared CA, display assets, user templates, the activity log) goes through one storage layer. `--storage`, or the `EUDI_DEV_STORAGE` environment variable, picks the backend:

| Value | State lives in |
|-------|----------------|
| `file` (default) | The wallet directory described above |
| `memory` | The process. A `wallet serve` on memory starts empty and forgets everything on exit |
| `auto` | Files when `--wallet-dir` or `EUDI_DEV_HOME` is given or the state directory holds state, memory otherwise. The [Docker image](docker.md#storage) default |
| `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` | One table (`eudi_dev_state`) in that database. Several wallet servers pointed at it serve one wallet state |

Every backend stores the keys, certificates, assets and templates under the same names. The file backend keeps the wallet itself as `wallet.json`, the memory and Postgres backends keep it as one row per credential, log entry and status entry, so several servers can change it at once. The wallet directory identifies the wallet on every backend, so a CLI command finds the server serving `~/.eudi-dev/wallet` whichever backend that server uses. `GET /api/config` reports the backend as `storage`. The default wallet is keyed `wallet` in a database wherever the process runs, so a CLI on the host and containers pointed at the same database address the same wallet.

The flag and the variable apply to every command that opens the wallet, `issue --wallet` and `templates` included.
