# Examples

Runnable integration scenarios live under [`examples/`](../examples/README.md).

Each scenario is a complete, version-pinned local setup: compose files, bootstrap scripts, wallet preparation, flow diagrams, and the parameter values it uses. Its README covers prerequisites, quick start, and cleanup.

## Scenarios

### Keycloak Issuer + eudi-dev Wallet

Folder: [`examples/keycloak-issuer-wallet`](../examples/keycloak-issuer-wallet/README.md)

Runs Keycloak `26.7.2` as an OpenID4VCI issuer and redeems the offer with an `eudi-dev` wallet.

It includes:

- a Keycloak compose setup
- issuer bootstrap scripts
- a helper to create a pre-authorized credential offer
- a wallet redemption helper

### Keycloak Verifier + keycloak-extension-oid4vp

Folder: [`examples/keycloak-verifier-oid4vp`](../examples/keycloak-verifier-oid4vp/README.md)

Runs Keycloak `26.7.2` as an OpenID4VP verifier with `keycloak-extension-oid4vp` and `eudi-dev` as the wallet.

It includes:

- a provider download script for the published extension jar
- wallet generation helpers
- verifier bootstrap scripts
- a headless same-device login test
- a browser-driven command-line flow that works with a registered `eudi-dev` wallet

### Keycloak Issuer + Verifier Demo App

Folder: [`examples/keycloak-issuer-verifier-app`](../examples/keycloak-issuer-verifier-app/README.md)

One Keycloak `26.7.2` instance signs users in with their wallet (`keycloak-extension-oid4vp`, subject-binding model) and issues a membership credential during the first login. Later logins present the PID together with that credential and need no password. A Go relying party runs the login.

It includes:

- a Keycloak compose setup with the OID4VP provider jar, the realm import, and the wallet CA in its truststore
- a static realm with the verifier, the subject-binding first broker login flow, the membership credential scope, and the trust material
- a bootstrap script that adds a CA-issued realm signing key
- a small Go relying party with a wallet sign-in
- HAIP verifier settings using `haip-vp://`, `direct_post.jwt`, and `x509_hash`
- a headless smoke test that runs the first (password plus offer) and second (passwordless) login

### Keycloak + Web Wallet (Web URLs Instead of Custom Schemes)

Folder: [`examples/keycloak-web-wallet`](../examples/keycloak-web-wallet/README.md)

Runs issuer, verifier, and wallet in containers with plain web URLs. One Keycloak `26.7.2` instance issues and verifies (`keycloak-extension-oid4vp`), the `eudi-dev` wallet runs as a compose service, and the verifier's `walletScheme` points at the wallet's `/authorize` URL. Verification is an ordinary browser OIDC login. This setup suits hosted environments, automated tests, and non-macOS platforms.

It includes:

- one compose project where all services share one network namespace, so every URL is plain `localhost` for both the host browser and the containers
- a demo UI (port 9090) with clickable localhost wallet links for issuance and a normal OIDC "Login with wallet" flow for verification
- static issuer and verifier realms reused from the two smaller examples, plus an admin-API step that points the verifier's `walletScheme` / `trustListUrl` at the wallet
- headless demos that call `GET /credential-offer` and `GET /authorize`
- automatic wallet-CA export into Keycloak's truststore for the status-list revocation check

### Keycloak + Public Demo Wallet

Folder: [`examples/keycloak-web-wallet-public`](../examples/keycloak-web-wallet-public/README.md)

Runs the web wallet scenario against the public demo at `https://eudi-test.dev` (or any other `--demo` deployment). Keycloak and the demo UI run locally.

It includes:

- a compose project that reuses the realms, extension jar, demo UI, and scripts of `keycloak-web-wallet`
- an ngrok tunnel in front of the local Keycloak, since the public wallet fetches the request object and calls the token endpoint server side (or set `KEYCLOAK_PUBLIC_URL` to your own public URL)
- the same admin-API step pointing the verifier's `walletScheme` / `trustListUrl` at the public wallet

### Load Test Target

Folder: [`examples/load-test`](../examples/load-test/README.md)

Two wallet servers share one Postgres database behind an nginx ingress, so every request lands on either server and both serve the same wallet. The target for load and performance tests of verifiers, issuers and the wallet.

It includes:

- a compose file with Postgres, two wallet servers and nginx
- an nginx config with round robin for API clients and a sticky session for browsers
- the endpoints to drive and how to add servers
