An unofficial developer toolkit for the EUDI and OpenID4VC ecosystem. Decode, issue, and present verifiable credentials, run a testing wallet, or proxy live wallet traffic for debugging. The CLI command is `eudi`.

> **Try it online:** a shared public demo of the wallet and decoder runs at **<https://eudi-test.dev>**. Issue, present, and decode test credentials in the browser. State is shared between all visitors and resets daily, so do not enter personal data.

## Highlights

- **Testing Wallet**: stateful CLI wallet persisted to files, memory or Postgres, OID4VP/VCI flows, QR scanning, and OS URL scheme registration ([wallet](#wallet))
- **Reverse Proxy**: intercept, classify, and decode OID4VP/VCI wallet traffic in real time ([proxy](#proxy))
- **Web UI**: paste, decode, and validate credentials in a split-pane browser interface ([serve](#serve))
- **Unified Decode**: a single `decode` command handles SD-JWT, JWT VC, JWT, mDOC, OID4VCI offers, OID4VP requests, and ETSI trust lists
- **QR Screen Capture**: scan a QR code straight from your screen to decode credentials or OpenID requests ([decode --screen](#decode))
- **Offline Decode & Validate**: SD-JWT, JWT VC, mDOC, JWT with signature verification and trust list support
- **DCQL Generation**: generate Digital Credentials Query Language queries from existing credentials

## Compared to other EUDI tooling

Most EUDI test tooling is an issuer or a verifier that you point a wallet at. This is the wallet, so the thing under test is your issuer or your verifier.

| Tool | What it tests | Runs locally | Scriptable |
|---|---|---|---|
| **eudi-dev** | your issuer or verifier | yes | CLI and HTTP API |
| [Animo OpenID4VC Playground](https://playground.animo.id/) | your wallet | self-hostable | no, web UI |
| [EUDIPLO Playground](https://playground.eudi-wallet.org/) | your wallet | self-hostable | no, web UI |
| [EUDI reference issuer and verifier](https://docs.eudi.dev/latest/test/issuer/) | your wallet | issuer only | no, web UI |
| [EUDI Web Wallet Tester](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-app-web-wallet-tester-py) | your issuer, OID4VCI only | yes | no, web UI |
| [EUDI reference wallet](https://github.com/eu-digital-identity-wallet/eudi-app-android-wallet-ui) (Android, iOS) | your issuer or verifier | on a device | no |
| [Procivis One](https://github.com/procivis/one-wallet) trial apps | your issuer or wallet | on a device | no |
| [Multipaz](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/multipaz) | your wallet or issuer, and proximity | SDK, apps, [hosted issuer and verifier](https://verifier.multipaz.org) | no |
| [Paradym debuggers](https://paradym.id/articles/developer-tool-sdjwtvc-debugger) | one credential, decoded | no | no |
| SDKs: [walt.id](https://docs.walt.id/), [Sphereon](https://github.com/Sphereon-Opensource/OID4VC), [Credo](https://github.com/openwallet-foundation/credo-ts), [Procivis One](https://github.com/procivis/one-core) | whatever you build | yes | as you write it |

When to use something else:

- For certification, the OIDF suite is the authority. This repository runs its plans (see [conformance](docs/conformance.md)), but only the OIDF certifies.
- To test a wallet, point it at one of the hosted issuer or verifier services above.
- To ship a product, use an SDK. Everything here is under `internal/`.
- For proximity flows (BLE, NFC), use Multipaz. This tool implements OID4VP over HTTP.
- To read a single credential, use a hosted decoder.

Never use real credentials (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS and Linux)

```bash
brew install dominikschlosser/tap/eudi-dev
```

Installs the `eudi` command with shell completion (plus `oid4vc-dev` as a legacy alias).

### From GitHub Releases

Download the latest binary for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev/releases).

### From source

```bash
go install github.com/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev@latest
```

This installs the binary as `eudi-dev` (Go names it after the module). The documentation calls the command `eudi`. Link it for the shorter name: `ln -s "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/eudi-dev" "$(go env GOPATH)/bin/eudi"`.

The module path is `github.com/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev`. Installing through the old `oid4vc-dev` path fails with a version constraints conflict, because the module declares only the new path.

### Build locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev.git
cd eudi-dev
go build -o eudi .
```

### Docker

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev:latest
docker run -p 8085:8085 -p 8086:8086 ghcr.io/dominikschlosser/eudi-dev
```

The default CMD starts the wallet server headless with pre-loaded PID credentials. The container keeps its state in memory and needs no volume.

→ [OIDF conformance status](docs/conformance.md), [runbook](docs/conformance-run.md), and [results](docs/conformance-results.md)
→ [Examples](docs/examples.md)

## Usage

```
eudi [--json] [--no-color] [-v] <command> [flags] [input]
```

Input can be a **file path**, **URL**, **raw credential string**, or piped via **stdin**.

Shell completion covers all subcommands, flags, and known values (template names, credential IDs, running wallet instances). Install it for bash, zsh, or fish (detected from `$SHELL`):

```bash
eudi completion install
```

### Wallet

A stateful testing wallet with CLI-driven OID4VP/VCI flows, QR scanning, and OS URL scheme registration. State lives in files by default, or in memory or Postgres with `--storage`.

```bash
eudi issue sdjwt --wallet --template pid-sdjwt         # Issue a PID into the wallet
eudi wallet serve                 # Start web UI + OID4VP endpoints
eudi wallet ca-cert --out wallet-ca-cert.pem
eudi wallet tls-cert --out wallet-tls-cert.pem
eudi wallet accept 'openid4vp://authorize?...'
eudi wallet scan --screen         # QR scan → auto-dispatch
eudi wallet logs -f               # Follow persisted wallet interactions
```

> **Security:** The wallet server has **no authentication**. Anyone who can reach its port controls the wallet and its credentials. Run it on localhost or an isolated test network, and never put real credentials in it. Every web page you visit can reach localhost, so the `/api/` endpoints refuse requests carrying an `Origin` from another site. The exception is `/api/dc-api`, which a verifier's page calls from its own origin. That endpoint relies on the reported origin and the consent dialog. For internet-facing hosting, the `--demo` profile disables the process and filesystem endpoints and blocks fetches into private networks. [eudi-test.dev](https://eudi-test.dev) runs this profile. See [public demo hosting](docs/public-demo.md).

`wallet serve` starts the local wallet UI plus HTTP and HTTPS wallet endpoints for presentation, issuer metadata, trust lists, status lists, and test registrar responses. `issue ... --wallet --template pid-sdjwt` puts a PID into the wallet (`wallet generate-pid` is deprecated). `wallet ca-cert` and `wallet tls-cert` export the trust root or the HTTPS leaf certificate for a verifier. All of these operations are also on the server's unauthenticated [HTTP API](docs/wallet/http-api.md), so automated tests can drive a hosted or containerized wallet over HTTP.

The main commands:
- `wallet serve` to run the wallet
- `issue ... --wallet` (with `--template` or `--pid`) to preload credentials
- `wallet ps` to find running wallet servers, `wallet use <url>` to manage one remotely over its REST API, and `wallet kill` to stop one. When a server already runs for the same wallet directory, CLI commands route through it. Discovery covers instances on this system plus the active remote target. A wallet inside a Docker container shows up after `wallet use <url>`, and clicked credential-offer or presentation links then route to it.
- `wallet trust-list` to get the verifier trust-list URL or JWT
- `wallet logs` to inspect wallet-side OID4VP/OID4VCI interactions
- `wallet ca-cert` and `wallet tls-cert` to export certificate material
- `wallet --mode debug|strict` and `--preferred-format ...` to control runtime behavior
- `wallet serve --haip` to check verifiers and issuers against HAIP 1.0

`--mode` and `--haip` are separate switches. `--haip` adds the HAIP 1.0 checks to the ones that always run. `--mode` decides how the wallet handles a finding, HAIP violations included. `--mode strict` stops the flow, `--mode debug` reports the finding and continues. See [HAIP 1.0 enforcement](docs/wallet/presenting.md#haip-10-enforcement).

When a wallet exposes multiple trust-list profiles, `/api/trustlists` lists the available IDs and routes. Use the entry's relative `path` when you reach the wallet through Docker port mappings or similar indirection. The web UI lists the same trust-list URLs with copy buttons above the certificate downloads.

### Issue

Generate test SD-JWT, JWT, or mDOC credentials for development and testing.

```bash
eudi issue sdjwt --pid
eudi issue sdjwt --template employee-card --claims '{"employee_id": "E-42"}'
eudi issue sdjwt --pid --always-disclosed issuing_country,address.country
eudi issue jwt --claims '{"name":"Test","age":30}'
eudi issue mdoc --claims '{"name":"Test"}' --doc-type com.example.test
eudi issue sdjwt | eudi decode
```

Credential templates hold reusable claim sets (`templates list|show|save|import|delete`). A template carries the credential type, default claims, and the always disclosed claims. Templates work in the CLI, the HTTP API, and the wallet UI.

→ [Credential templates](docs/templates.md): template files, management commands, always disclosed claims

---

### Proxy

Intercept and debug OID4VP/VCI traffic between a wallet and a verifier/issuer with a live web dashboard.

```bash
eudi proxy --target http://localhost:8080
```

```
Wallet  <-->  Proxy (:9090)  <-->  Verifier/Issuer (:8080)
                  |
            Live dashboard (:9091)
```

→ [Full documentation](docs/proxy.md): traffic classification, features, flags

---

### Serve

Start a local web UI for decoding and validating credentials in the browser.

```bash
eudi serve
eudi serve --port 3000
eudi serve credential.txt
```

Opens a split-pane interface at `http://localhost:8080` (default) with auto-decode on paste, format detection, collapsible sections, signature verification, and dark/light theme. A credential passed as argument pre-fills the input. `--imprint-file` serves a legal notice at `/imprint` for public hosting.

![Web UI screenshot](docs/assets/web-ui.png)

> **Warning:** Credentials are sent to the server for decoding. Run it locally, or see [public demo hosting](docs/public-demo.md) for an internet-facing setup.

---

### Decode

Auto-detect and decode credentials (SD-JWT, JWT VC, mDOC), OpenID4VCI/VP requests, and ETSI trust lists.

```bash
eudi decode credential.txt
eudi decode 'openid4vp://authorize?...'
eudi decode --screen                    # QR scan from screen
```

→ [Full documentation](docs/decode.md): auto-detection order, format override, QR scanning, flags

---

### Validate

Verify signatures, check expiry, and check revocation status.

```bash
eudi validate --key issuer-key.pem credential.txt
eudi validate --trust-list trust-list.jwt credential.txt
eudi validate credential.txt
```

→ [Full documentation](docs/validate.md): flags, trust list explanation

---

### DCQL

Generate a DCQL (Digital Credentials Query Language) query from a credential's claims. Output is always JSON.

```bash
eudi dcql credential.txt
```

The wallet evaluates `credential_sets` constraints when processing DCQL queries, selecting the best matching option from each set.

**Example output (SD-JWT):**

```json
{
  "credentials": [
    {
      "id": "urn_eudi_pid_1",
      "format": "dc+sd-jwt",
      "meta": { "vct_values": ["urn:eudi:pid:1"] },
      "claims": [
        { "path": ["birth_date"] },
        { "path": ["family_name"] },
        { "path": ["given_name"] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
