# Architecture

The package layout and how a request passes through it. The reasons are in the [decision records](#decisions).

For the vocabulary these documents use, see [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md).

## Layout

```
main.go        Entry point
cmd/           CLI commands (Cobra), one file per command or command group
internal/      Everything else (ADR-0007)
e2e/           Playwright tests against a running wallet server
examples/      Keycloak and web-wallet integration examples
```

| `web` | Decoder and validator web UI |

## Flows

**Decode and validate.** Input arrives from a file, URL, stdin or a QR scan. Format detection picks the parser. The parser produces a token or document. The result is printed or carried into verification (signature, validity period, revocation).

**Presentation (OID4VP).** An authorization request arrives as a URI, an HTTP request to the wallet, or a browser API call. Its parameters may be inside a request object, fetched by reference and possibly encrypted. A request object replaces the parameter set, so the wallet acts on what the verifier signed. The wallet validates the request (client identifier, request object, signature, required parameters) and handles findings according to the active validation mode (ADR-0001). With `--haip` it also checks the request against HAIP, and those violations are errors in either mode. It then matches the request against held credentials with DCQL. The wallet answers a request for a type with a credential of that type or of one extending it. The user consents or the wallet auto-accepts. The wallet builds a VP token (SD-JWT with a key binding JWT, or an mdoc DeviceResponse) and sends it to the verifier, encrypted when the response mode asks for it.

**Issuance (OID4VCI).** A credential offer arrives by URI or by reference. The wallet fetches issuer metadata and authorization server metadata. It then runs the pre-authorized code flow or the authorization code flow (PAR, PKCE, DPoP and client attestation as the issuer's metadata requires). At OpenID4VCI feature level 1.1, the wallet runs the interactive flow instead when the issuer publishes an authorization challenge endpoint. The wallet answers the challenge with an OpenID4VP presentation or sends the user to a browser sign-in (`auth_via_web`) and exchanges the resulting code as usual. It proves possession of its holder key, receives the credential, and imports it. An issuer that defers returns a transaction id, and the wallet collects the credential in the background.

**Proxy.** The wallet connects to a verifier or issuer through the proxy. The proxy classifies each exchange as an OID4VP or OID4VCI step and shows it on a dashboard.
