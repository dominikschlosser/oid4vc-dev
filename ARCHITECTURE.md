# Architecture

This guide describes the packages and request flows. The [decision records](#decisions) explain the design choices.

For the vocabulary these documents use, see [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md).

## Layout

```
main.go        Entry point
cmd/           CLI commands (Cobra), one file per command or command group
internal/      Everything else (ADR-0007)
e2e/           Playwright tests against a running wallet server
examples/      Keycloak and web-wallet integration examples
```

| `sdjwt` | SD-JWT parsing, disclosure resolution, verification |
| `statuslist` | Token Status List encoding and decoding, in JWT and CWT form |
| `storage` | Blob storage backed by files, memory or Postgres (ADR-0016) |
| `trustlist` | ETSI TS 119 602 trust list parsing |

| `web` | Decoder and validator web UI |

## Flows

**Decode and validate.** The tool accepts a file, URL, stdin or QR scan. It detects the format and parses the input. It then displays the result or checks its signature, validity period and revocation status.

**Presentation (OID4VP).** The wallet receives an authorization request through a URI, HTTP endpoint or browser API. It fetches and decrypts a request object when needed. Parameters inside the request object replace the outer parameters.

The wallet checks the client identifier, signature and required parameters. Debug mode reports findings and continues. Strict mode stops on findings. `--haip` adds the profile checks. DCQL selects matching credentials, including credentials whose type extends the requested type.

After consent or automatic approval, the wallet creates an SD-JWT with a key binding JWT or an mdoc DeviceResponse. It sends the VP token to the verifier and encrypts it when the response mode requires encryption.

**Issuance (OID4VCI).** The wallet resolves a credential offer and fetches issuer and authorization server metadata. It follows the pre-authorized code flow or authorization code flow, using PAR, PKCE, DPoP and client attestation as required.

At feature level 1.1, an advertised authorization challenge endpoint selects the interactive flow. The wallet responds with an OpenID4VP presentation or opens browser authentication through `auth_via_web`. It then exchanges the authorization code.

The wallet proves possession of its holder key, receives the credential and imports it. If the issuer defers issuance, the wallet saves the transaction ID and collects the credential later.

**Proxy.** The wallet connects to a verifier or issuer through the proxy. The proxy classifies each exchange as an OID4VP or OID4VCI step and shows it on a dashboard.
